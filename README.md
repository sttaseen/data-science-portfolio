# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains my completed data science projects that I found interesting and commented enough to be sharable.

_Note: Some data used in this project is fake and created only for practise purposes._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc. Install jupyter notebook by using pip:
```
pip install notebook
```
To run, use:
```
jupyter notebook
```

	- [KMeansClustering: Cluster Public/Private University Students](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out K Means Clustering algorithm to build a model that accurately clusters students from private and public universities.
	- [Recommender System: Movie Recommender](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): A supervised model to recommend movies based on users and their reviews.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Frozen Lake Environment](https://github.com/sajal2692/Training-a-Smartcab-to-Drive): Implementing an optimized Q-Learning agent that will navigate a non-deterministic environment with a fairly high success rate by using reinforcement learning.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Pygame_

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Yelp Reviews](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/3-Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): Classifying the star rating of a yelp review based on the text that the review contains.

- ### Deep Learning

	- [DNN Approach: LendingClub Loan Repayment](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/3-Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): Trying out a deep learning approach to model if a debtor would or would not repay their debt based on their personal information.
	- [DNN: King County House Prices] Using deep learning to predict house prices in King County based on house features like location, number of bedrooms, space etc.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Ecommerce Customer Time Spread Analysis](https://github.com/sajal2692/Scalable-Walkability-Analysis-of-Melbourne): Analysis of time spent by users in-store, on the company's mobile app and on their website to determine needed improvements for the company.
		- [Ad-Click Based on Personal Info](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Analysis of the likelihood of an ad being clicked based on the features of the ad and the personal info of the user.

		
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

	- __R__ 
		As a part of part-II software engineering, I have done some data analysis in R here. These are uncommented and not pleasing to the eye. I will format these in the future to be readable.

- ### Micro Projects: 
	- [Benford's Law: US Elections](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Graphing different US Presidential elections to see if Benford's Law applies to them.
	- [Adding Numbers Using NN](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Optimising the number of nodes required to add two numbers.
	- [Multiplying Numbers Using NN](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Limit testing concepts to implement a simple neural network that can multiply numbers.
	
	_Tools: Pandas, and scikit-learn_
	
- ### Computer Vision: 
	- [Object Detection: Sign Language](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Training a tensorflow object detection model to read sign language and translate to text in real-time (currently working on it).
	
	_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Opencv2 and Tensorflow_
